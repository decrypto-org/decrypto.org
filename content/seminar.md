abstract = """
The high latency and low throughput of Bitcoin constitute two fundamental barriers for its wider adoption. The Lightning Network, an overlay protocol that can be run on top of Bitcoin, provides the most comprehensive solution to those issues by enabling unlimited off-chain payments with minimal latency between parties that share a payment channel.
In this talk we give an intuitive exposition of the Lightning protocol and its various capabilities. We describe the steps needed for setting up, using, and closing a 2-party Lightning channel, arguing that they are secure. We discuss the single disadvantage of Lightning compared to using the blockchain directly, namely that parties have to actively sync with the blockchain often to avoid losing funds. Finally, we highlight one of the most important -- and complex -- features of Lightning, multi-hop payments: leveraging well-understood cryptographic primitives and finely-tuned timeouts, a buyer can pay a seller even if they don't have an open channel between them.

title = "Implementing a practical superlight Bitcoin client"
abstract = """
During the last years, significant effort has been put into enabling blockchain interoperability. Towards this goal, a new generation of verifiers have emerged called superlight clients. We focus on Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof of Work (NIPoPoW) superblock protocol, and we discuss a gas-efficient implementation for the verification of NIPoPoWs in Solidity. In particular, we explore patterns and techniques that considerably reduce gas consumption, and may also have applications to other smart contracts. We introduce a pattern that we term "hash-and-resubmit" that eliminates persistent storage almost entirely, leading to significant increase of performance. Furthermore, we alleviate the burden of expensive on-chain operations, which we transfer off-chain, and we make use of an optimistic schema that replaces functionalities of linear complexity with constant operations. Lastly, we make a cryptoeconomic analysis, and set concrete values regarding the cost of usage of our client.

abstract = """
Off-chain protocols (channels) are a promising solution to the scalability and privacy challenges of blockchain payments. Current proposals, however, require synchrony assumptions to preserve the safety of a channel, leaking to an adversary the exact amount of time needed to control the network for a successful attack.
In this talk, we discuss BRICK, the first payment channel that remains secure under network asynchrony and concurrently provides correct incentives.
The core idea is to incorporate the conflict resolution process within the channel by introducing a rational committee of external parties, called wardens. Hence, if a party wants to close a channel unilaterally, it can only get the committee's approval for the last valid state.
BRICK provides sub-second latency because it does not employ heavy-weight consensus. Instead, BRICK uses consistent broadcast to announce updates and close the channel, a light-weight abstraction that is powerful enough to preserve safety and liveness to any rational parties.

abstract = """
The primary function of a cryptocurrency is money transfer between individuals. The wallet is the software that facilitates such transfers. Wallets are nowadays ubiquitous in the cryptocurrency space and a cryptocurrency is usually supported by many wallets. Despite that, the functionality of wallets has never been formally defined. Additionally, the mechanisms employed by the many wallets in the wild remain hidden in their respective codebases.

In this work we provide the first definition of a cryptocurrency wallet, which we model as a client to a server, or set of servers. We provide a distinction of wallets in various categories, based on whether they work for transparent or private cryptocurrencies, what trust assumptions they require, their performance and their communication overhead. For each type of wallet we provide a description of its client and server protocols. Additionally, we explore the superlight wallets and describe their difference to superlight clients that have appeared in recent literature. We demonstrate how new wallet protocols can be produced by combining concepts from existing protocols. Finally we evaluate the performance and security characteristics of all wallet protocols and compare them.

Nodes can now transact even without having a direct channel, thus the need for a complete graph between nodes is relaxed -- just a connected graph with sufficient capacity is enough for any party to transact with any other. We will understand why parties along a payment path can trustlessly and securely send, receive, or facilitate the transfer of value.

In this presentation, we investigate how a blockchain can be upgraded to support superblock clients without a soft fork. We show that it is possible to implement the needed changes without modifying the consensus protocol and by requiring only a minority of miners to upgrade, a process termed a velvet fork in the literature. While previous work conjectured that Superblock and FlyClient clients can be safely deployed using velvet forks as-is, we show that previous constructions are insecure. We describe a novel class of attacks, called chain-sewing, which arise in the velvet fork setting: an adversary can cut-and-paste portions of various chains from independent forks, sewing them together to fool a superlight client into accepting a false claim. We show how previous velvet fork constructions can be attacked via chain-sewing. Next we put forth the first provably secure velvet superblock client construction which we show  secure against adversaries that are bounded by 1/3 of the upgraded honest miner population.

abstract = """
Centralized pools and renting of mining power are considered as sources of possible censorship threats and even 51% attacks for decentralized cryptocurrencies. Non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work schemes have been proposed to tackle these issues. However, tenets in the folklore say that such schemes could potentially be bypassed by using escrow mechanisms.

We consider how to bypass non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work schemes using collateralized smart contracts. Our approach allows for that if the underlying blockchain platform supports smart contracts in a sufficiently advanced language. In particular, the language should allow access to the PoW solution.

At a high level, our approach requires the miner to lock collateral covering the reward amount and protected by a smart contract that acts as an escrow. The smart contract has logic that allows the pool to collect the collateral as soon as the miner collects any block reward. We propose two variants of the approach depending on when the collateral is bound to the block solution. Using this, we show how to bypass previously proposed non-outsourceable Proof-of-Work schemes (with the notable exception for strong non-outsourceable schemes) and show how to build mining pools for such schemes.

Distributed ledgers implement a storage layer, on top of which a shared state which is maintained by all participants in a decentralized manner. In UTxO-based ledgers, like Bitcoin, the shared state is the set of all unspent outputs (UTxOs), which serve as inputs to future transactions. However, decentralized systems lack centrally planned policies to enforce proper maintenance of the shared state, such as garbage collection, which would enhance performance and prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Instead, the system's design aims at incentivizing participants to act as intended. In this talk we investigate correct practices, such that the shared state in distributed ledgers is managed efficiently. We consider an abstract ledger model and investigate a set of transaction optimization techniques, including a coin selection algorithm which aims at minimizing the shared state. We also define state efficiency, which is the necessary property that a distributed ledger's fee scheme should possess in order to incentivize efficient state management, and propose an amended, efficient fee function for Bitcoin.

title = "Aggregate weighted signatures for Blockchain Bootstrapping"
abstract = """
Proof of Stake Blockchains operate by having participants demonstrate that
they control a certain piece of stake, chosen by some selection mechanism.
In contrast, proof of work blockchains require that participants provide a
solution to some computational problem with restrictions indicated by the context.
Such solutions can usually be verified in isolation and at low computational cost.

In many current Proof of Stake implementations, verifying a claim of stake either
requires a large context or a somewhat complex proof. These costs are exacerbated
when a new user wishes to participate for the first time, as verifying the current
state will often require replaying operations since the genesis.

We introduce the primitive of weighted aggregate signatures and use it to offer a
simple solution to speed up bootstrapping: we produce an aggregate signature
for verifying a succinct checkpoint for each epoch. Our approach minimizes computational
costs to small stakeholders and is compatible with recent advances such as key-evolving
signatures and delegation.

title = "Updatable Blockchains"
abstract = """
Software updates for blockchain systems become a real challenge when they impact the underlying consensus mechanism. The activation of such changes might jeopardize the integrity of the blockchain by resulting in chain splits. Moreover, the software update process should be handed over to the community and this means that the blockchain should support updates without relying on a trusted party. In this paper, we introduce the notion of updatable blockchains and show how to construct blockchains that satisfy this definition. Informally, an updatable blockchain is a secure blockchain and in addition it allows to update its protocol preserving the history of the chain. In this work, we focus only on the processes that allow securely switching from one blockchain protocol to another assuming that the blockchain protocols are correct. That is, we do not aim at providing a mechanism that allows reaching consensus on what is the code of the new blockchain protocol. We just assume that such a mechanism exists (like the one proposed in NDSS 2019 by Zhang et. al), and show how to securely go from the old protocol to the new one. The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows. We provide the first formal definition of updatable ledgers and propose the description of two compilers. These compilers take a blockchain and turn it into an updatable blockchain. The first compiler requires the structure of the current and the updated blockchain to be very similar (only the structure of the blocks can be different) but it allows for an update process more simple, efficient. The second compiler that we propose is very generic (i.e., makes few assumptions on the similarities between the structure of the current blockchain and the update blockchain). The drawback of this compiler is that it requires the new blockchain to be resilient against a specific adversarial behaviour and requires all the honest parties to be online during the update process. However, we show how to get rid of the latest requirement (the honest parties being online during the update) in the case of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake ledgers.

construct a blockchain protocol whose security can be reduced to them in the
standard model assuming a common reference string (CRS).The three properties
are: collision resistance, computational randomness extraction and iterated
hardness. While the first two properties have been extensively studied, iterated
hardness has been empirically stress-tested since the rise of Bitcoin; in fact,
as we demonstrate in this paper, any attack against it (assuming the other two
properties hold) results in an attack against Bitcoin.In addition, iterated
hardness puts forth a new class of search problems which we term iterated search
problems (ISP). ISPs enable the concise and modular specification of blockchain
protocols, and may be of independent interest.

abstract = """
Decentralised Randomness Beacon (DRB) is a service that generates publicly verifiable randomness. Constructing DRB protocols is challenging. Existing DRB protocols suffer from strong network synchrony assumptions, high communication complexity and/or various attacks. In this paper, we propose RandChain, a new family of DRB protocols. RandChain is constructed from Sequential Proof-of-Work (SeqPoW), a Proof-of-Work (PoW) variant that is sequential, i.e., the work can only be done by a single processor. In RandChain, nodes jointly maintain a blockchain, and each block derives a random output. To append a block to the blockchain, each node should keep mining, i.e., solve a SeqPoW puzzle derived from the last block and its identity. Given the SeqPoW and its fixed input, mining is non-parallelisable. RandChain applies Nakamoto consensus so that nodes agree on a unique blockchain.

While inheriting simplicity and scalability from Nakamoto consensus, RandChain produces strongly unpredictable randomness and remains energy-efficient and decentralised. RandChain does not require nodes to provide local entropy, thus giving no opportunity to bias randomness. Solutions of SeqPoW puzzles are unpredictable, so nodes cannot predict randomness. As each node can use at most a single processor for mining, RandChain remains energy-efficient. The mining speed is bound by processorsâ clock rate, which is hard to improve further. Thus, powerful nodes can gain limited advantage over mining, and RandChain achieves a high degree of decentralisation.
